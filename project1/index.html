<h1>Computer Components</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><p>The components we will be discussing in the following webpages include; the motherboard, central processing unit, random access memory, and the solid state drive. The learning objective for each page is for the user to learn how to identify these parts, understand their basic functions, and gain insight into the history of each stated part. As anyone alive today could tell you, since the emergence of computer hardware and the internet humanity’s understanding of the mysteries of the universe has skyrocketed beyond what anyone a few centuries ago could have ever believed. Computers are going to be a constant in our future and those who don’t want to be left to the stone ages should endeavor to gather the skills needed to operate and maintain a computer system.</p></p>

<p>Should you prefer, provided below is a wonderfully informative video created by a channel called 'Tech with Tim.' The content creator in the video does not cover the history of each component, however they provide insight for those who are interested in purchasing upgrades for desktop computers.</p>
