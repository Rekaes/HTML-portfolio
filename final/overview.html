            <p class="paragraphs">I realized, after pouring hours of my time into researching opium, that I sincerely held little knowledge of the subject. I merely thought opium was ‘that drug from China that the British liked to use during the 1800s.’ I had heard of opium dens and I had seen it was smoked from a long pipe or a hookah. It was honestly an experience that, I felt, truly opened my eyes to the nature of our world and the structures we are built upon. I think without the existence of opium we would not have such advanced medical procedures nor the wildly vivid art and music we have developed. 
                I can say that I no longer look down on opiates as I have grown to understand the impact it has had on our culture and medicine.</p>

            <h1 class="headers">Legality</h1>
            <p class="paragraphs">The LATEST publication regarding the legality of opium was published by the U.S. Government Printing Offices in the year 1981. Thankfully the ‘contents’ pages provide a sufficient summary of the legal history of opium (particularly as a recreational drug). 
                The question of legality regarding the use of opium has been relatively consistent in the past hundred years. Being that it is illegal to consume opium for any reason other than that of a medical nature. Opium was always legal for use as a medicinal drug and it was only until 1914 that the drug was outlawed for other than medical purposes. The consequences of opium consumption, following the outlawing of recreational use, were always steep. In reference to the cost an offender would be expected to pay in 1914, “the offender shall be fined In any sum not exceeding five thousand dollars nor less than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for any time not exceeding two years, or both.”(Walsh 1981) 
                If you adjust that 5,000 dollars for inflation today it would be well over 150,000 dollars, which still isn’t enough to buy a single-family home in 2023… suffice it to say the government frowned upon the use of opium in any capacity other than that of a medical nature.</p>

            <h1 class="headers">Cultural Impact</h1>
            <p class="paragraphs">There was a common trend in the early nineteenth century of poets writing about their experiences with opium. Many authors would write about how they had an ethereal, otherworldly experience, which is speculated to have aided in their works as the high would provide an escape from the ‘dull’ everyday routine. A notable observation made by author Hannah Freeman in her research regarding the correlation between opium use and women's poetry is that women of this time incorporated opium use as a medicinal tool meant to aid in their motherly and wifely duties. (Freeman 1) 
                It’s no secret that women did not have many freedoms during that time frame and its use was a means of temporary relief.
