        <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
        <p>During my time spent studying web page design I have observed some key aspects regarding the properties of html tags and their function. an example of this is the fact that the symbols typically reserved for 'less than' and 'greater than' as well as the fraction symbol '/' carry different meanings in html programming than they do in mathematics. The '<' '>' symbols are used for opening and closing tags, and in the closing tag is this right here '/'. "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;" Here is an example of an opening tag and a closing tag, in that order. Because I am typing in the html program if I insert text between those two tags it should show up on your screen in the heading 2 format. <h2>How about those apples?</h2> Tags are important because they establish the content of your web page. When you use software such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs you manipulate html tags. When you change your font from title to heading 1, or when you underline something in your text you are using different tags. You can use tags in between other tags as well. In conclusion, HTML tags are vital for properly formatting a web page and make it less confusing for the user overall.

I wanted to include the actual <h1></h1> as an example in my writing
so I did some googling and found the info for HTML entities here. -->
